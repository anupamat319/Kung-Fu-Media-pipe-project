# 🥋 AI Kung Fu Stance Recognition System

##  Overview
The **AI Kung Fu Stance Recognition System** is a real-time computer vision application developed using **Python, MediaPipe, OpenCV, and NumPy**.  
It detects and classifies traditional Kung Fu stances through a live webcam feed by analyzing human body pose landmarks and joint angles.

This project demonstrates the practical use of **AI-based pose estimation** and **rule-based classification** for motion analysis.
