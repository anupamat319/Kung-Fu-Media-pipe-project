# 🥋 AI Kung Fu Stance Recognition System

## 📌 Overview
The **AI Kung Fu Stance Recognition System** is a real-time computer vision application developed using **Python, MediaPipe, OpenCV, and NumPy**.  
It detects and classifies traditional Kung Fu stances through a live webcam feed by analyzing human body pose landmarks and joint angles.

This project demonstrates the practical use of **AI-based pose estimation** and **rule-based classification** for motion analysis.

## 🥋 Supported Kung Fu Stances
The system recognizes the following stances in real time:

1. MA BU (Horse Stance)  
2. GONG BU (Bow Stance)  
3. XU BU (Empty Stance)  
4. PU BU (Drop Stance)  
5. XIE BU (Resting Stance)  
6. DU LI BU (Golden Rooster Stance)  
7. DING BU (T-Stance)  
8. UNKNOWN POSE

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Captures live video using a webcam
- Extracts human pose landmarks using **MediaPipe Pose**
- Calculates joint angles (knees, hips, ankles)
- Normalizes distances using torso length
- Applies rule-based logic to classify Kung Fu stances
- Uses a temporal buffer to smooth predictions
- Displays stance name and color feedback in real time
